# Lexical and syntactic analyzer in ANTRL4TS

In our project, we dedicated ourselves to an in-depth study of the ANTLR language, aiming to create lexical and syntactic analyzers. These components were developed to process the language used within the TDE - Calculator context. Through these analyzers, we are able to accurately verify and validate each of the provided test files, ensuring the robustness and effectiveness of our system.
